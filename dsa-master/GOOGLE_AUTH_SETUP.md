# Google Authentication Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Your DSA Tracker app now has Google authentication integrated! Follow these steps to enable it:

### 1. Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Add authorized origins:
     - `http://localhost:8000` (for local development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:8000` (for local development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)

### 2. Update Your App Configuration

1. Copy your Google Client ID from the credentials page
2. Open `app.js` and replace the demo client ID with your actual Client ID:
   ```javascript
   this.googleClientId = 'your-actual-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com';
   ```
3. Open `index.html` and replace the demo client ID in the g_id_onload div:
   ```html
   <div id="g_id_onload"
        data-client_id="your-actual-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com"
        data-callback="handleGoogleSignIn"
        data-auto_prompt="false">
   </div>
   ```

**Note**: The app currently has a demo client ID that works for testing the UI, but you'll need a real Google Client ID for actual authentication.

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Start your local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
3. Try signing in with Google using the new Google Sign-In button

## ✨ Features Added

### Authentication Options
- **Traditional Login**: Username/password authentication
- **Google Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Google account
- **Seamless Integration**: Both methods work together seamlessly

### User Experience
- Clean "or" divider between authentication methods
- Google Sign-In button matches your app's design
- Automatic user creation for new Google users
- Proper display of Google user names in the header

### Data Management
- Google users are stored with prefix `google_` + Google ID
- User progress is maintained separately for each authentication method
- Secure JWT token decoding for Google user information
- Proper logout handling for both authentication types

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Google Sign-In Flow
1. User clicks Google Sign-In button
2. Google OAuth popup opens
3. User authorizes the app
4. Google returns JWT token with user info
5. App decodes token and creates/updates user account
6. User is logged in and redirected to main app

### User Data Structure
```javascript
// Traditional user
users: {
  "username": {
    password: "hashed_password",
    joinDate: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}

// Google user
users: {
  "google_123456789": {
    id: "123456789",
    email: "user@gmail.com",
    name: "John Doe",
    picture: "https://...",
    authProvider: "google",
    joinDate: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid client ID" error**
   - Make sure you've replaced both instances of `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - Verify the Client ID is correct in Google Cloud Console

2. **"This app isn't verified" warning**
   - This is normal for development. Click "Advanced" > "Go to [app name] (unsafe)"
   - For production, you'll need to verify your app with Google

3. **Google Sign-In button not appearing**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure the Google Sign-In API script is loading
   - Verify your Client ID is correct

4. **Authentication works but user data isn't saved**
   - Check browser localStorage in DevTools
   - Ensure the user data structure is being created properly

### Development Tips

- Use browser DevTools to inspect localStorage and see user data
- Check the Network tab to see Google API calls
- Use the Console tab to see any JavaScript errors
- Test with different Google accounts to ensure proper isolation

## 🚀 Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update authorized origins in Google Cloud Console
2. Replace localhost URLs with your production domain
3. Consider implementing server-side token verification
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

The Google Sign-In integration works on mobile devices, but you may want to:
- Test on different mobile browsers
- Consider implementing Google Sign-In for mobile apps
- Ensure responsive design for the authentication forms
